- Response & Dispatch Management: Assign responders to incidents, track teams in real-time on a map, and update incident status (Reported, Verified, Team Dispatched, In Progress, Resolved).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF). Sky blue is commonly associated with emergency response, based on the historical use of emergency lights, and sky blue is one of the bluest, clearest sky colors.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE). Light gray serves as a neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the importance of the incident reports.
- Accent color: Light green (#90EE90). An analogous color to blue on the opposite side of the color wheel, it also calls to mind both nature, safety, and 'the clear'.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. These provide a modern, readable style suitable for important information.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for incident categories and map markers to enhance usability.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with a focus on readability and ease of navigation. Prioritize important information with visual hierarchy.
- Employ subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide users through the reporting and tracking processes.
